# Java Bidder Framework #

This is an implementation of the AppNexus Bidder Framework in Java.

The Bidder Framework is an open source project that enables users to quickly and easily create their own real-time bidders. We would like to thank our contributors for their help in maintaining this project.

This Google wiki contains the Bidder Framework code and a couple of tutorials that walk you through building basic bidders. For a high-level overview of the Bidder Framework and how it fits into the AdNexus platform, please see the AdNexus documentation wiki at https://wiki.appnexus.com/display/adnexusdocumentation/Build+a+Bidder. If you do not have a wiki login, please contact your AdNexus representative.

This is a work in progress and we encourage users to contribute to the code base. If you come across problems, bugs or have ideas on how these source may be improved, do not hesitate to contribute. This is meant to be a community effort.
